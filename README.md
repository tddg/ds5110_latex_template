# Template of DS 5110 Project Report


For Checkpoint #2 report, you may comment out `\input{metadata}` in `paper.tex` as
`metadata.tex` will only be used for the final report. 

The repo includes a makefile so you can directly `make` the PDF. 

More conveniently, you could use hosted Latex service such as Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) for collaborative latex editing with your teammates.
